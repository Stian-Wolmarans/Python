Changes:
	- Remove tile 12_12 from pile when pile is created not during tile dealing
	- merged buiid_pile, deal_tiles, create_players into one function called deal_tiles
	- used slicing instead of array split, much simpler code, likely less errors
	- optimized code by using while loops instead of for loops where possible
